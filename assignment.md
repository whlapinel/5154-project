# Project - Bring ML to your area of interest.

-For the project, you will be playing with the problem of your interest. Find a problem that you like to solve. It can be any subject!

-Creating your own solution will require more time than you think, so your goal of the project will duplicate how others solve the problem or practice what you have learned in this course to solve the problem.

-Here are possible steps you will take for the search:

1. Find data related to the problem or simulation model to play with. If you do not know where to start, take a look at our resource page for problems/applications/data.

2. Many data are from research projects and there are some published papers related to it. You will be able to find interesting solutions that you would like to duplicate. Although you decided to practice what you have learned in this course, you are still required to survey/ready related papers.  

3. The chosen paper is about implementing a new algorithm to solve the problem. In this case, you do not want to reimplement it from scratch. Thus, if the authors do not provide source codes, do not attempt to start from scratch unless you are confident to do so. Please talk to me if you want to discuss this. 

4. Many ML application papers rely on existing ML algorithms, so these are the easy ones you can reproduce by using some existing ML tools. 

5. Now, you can start reading the paper to understand and work on it. Feel free to come and talk to the instructors if you need discussions regarding the paper. Remember that you need to read at least three related papers for the project.  

Before moving forward, please click the project guides for you to see what you need to prepare and submit for the class project. 

Shared Repo: Be sure to create a shared repository (GitHub) and submit the address to it.  You can create an account if you do not have one and make a new empty repository to get the address.

These are initial check-in items for you to enter for credits. 

Changing the project topic is allowed as you proceed on the topics, thus don't worry about what you entered here being way too broad or what you like. You are fine to say "Project Topic: Machine Learning" for this submission. Just start thinking about what you would like to do for a project. 

For the submission, copy the following and fill in the text entry (no file submission).
